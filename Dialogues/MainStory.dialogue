Ghost: -and its 100 Credit unpaid mortgage,
Ghost: -due in a week.
You: Gee thanks dad, but...
You: -owning physical property is so last century.
Ghost: Err. What now?
You: The future is digital!

You: Sorry dad, but I am not about that life.
You: I live for one thing.
You: HARVESTING!
Ghost: But you need to do those other things to have anything to harvest!
You: No, I don't.
You: There are crops to harvest [do GameState.camera_target_neighbor()] right over there! 
Ghost: But those- those aren't yours! They belong to the neighbors!
do GameState.camera_target_player()
Ghost: That would be theft!
You: I'm taking the load off their hands, so it's even.
Ghost: What kind of son did I raise?
You: Then I'll exchange it for 1k Darko Cryptos to start my data mining venture.
Ghost: Were those words?
You: I'm a digital-soul-harvesting entrepreneur, dad. You wouldn't understand.
Ghost: Oh, it keeps getting worse. Where's that light? Take me already.
